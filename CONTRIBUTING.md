## How to Contribute
You can contribute in more ways than just code.\
Reporting bugs and other kind of feedback helps me improve the project already.

## Git Guidelines
### Git Branches
All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as a Pull Request.

Your branch should:
- be prefixed with either `feature` or `bugfix` depending on the type of change
- only add/fix one feature/bug at a time
- contain multiple commits, instead of one big commit, if possible

### Git Commits
Your commit should:
- be signed
- be written in present tense
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb (e.g. `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`)

## Repository Specifics
This repository doesn't have specific guidelines.
